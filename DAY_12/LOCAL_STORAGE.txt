Local Storage API :
localStorage persists data until explicitly cleared by the user or the web application.
LocalStorage is a web storage object to store the data on the user’s computer locally, which means the stored data is saved across browser sessions and the data stored has no expiration time.

Storing Data:
localStorage.setItem('username', 'GeeksforGeeks');

Retrieving Data:
const username = localStorage.getItem('username');

Updating Data:
localStorage.setItem('username', 'GfG');

Removing Data:
localStorage.removeItem('username');

Clearing All Data:
localStorage.clear();
