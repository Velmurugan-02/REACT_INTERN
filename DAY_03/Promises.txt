Promises :
It is Object representing of an asynchronous Operations and its resulting value .
States : Pending , Fulfilment , Rejected.
Methods : .then() => Handles both Fulfilment and Rejection.
	  .catch() => Handles Rejection
	  .finally() => Useful for cleanup
Example :
var promises = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
  let name = "Leo";
  let pass_word = "Nandhan da leo leo das";
  let user_name = prompt("Enter name","Vel");
  let user_pass = prompt("Enter password","****");
  if(user_name == "Leo" && user_pass == "Nandhan da leo leo das") resolve("Hello",`Hello {name}`);
  else reject("Enter correct name or password");
});
promises.then((message)=>{console.log(message);})
        .catch((error)=>{console.log(error);});

JavaScript Promises make handling asynchronous operations like API calls, file loading, or time delays easier. Think of a Promise as a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future. It can be in one of three states
1.Pending: The task is in the initial state.
2.Fulfilled: The task was completed successfully, and the result is available.
3.Rejected: The task failed, and an error is provided.

Example 1:
let checkEven = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let number = 4;
    if (number % 2 === 0) resolve("The number is even!");
    else reject("The number is odd!");
});
checkEven
    .then((message) => console.log(message)) // On success
    .catch((error) => console.error(error)); // On failure

Example 2:
fetch(url)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));


1. Promise.all() Method => If one promise rejects then it will break and return . If all promise are true then it will return as array .
2. Promise.allSettled() Method => Waits for all promises to settle (fulfilled or rejected) Method and returns an array of their outcomes.
3. Promise.race() Method => It resolves or rejects as soon as the first promise settles.
4. Promise.any() Method => It resolves with the first fulfilled promise. If all are rejected, it rejects with an AggregateError.
5. Promise.resolve() => It returns a promise that resolves with the given value.
