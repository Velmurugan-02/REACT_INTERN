Events :
Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser . They will be triggered by users interaction or by the browser.

Event Types:
Mouse Events: click, dblclick, mousemove, mouseover, mouseout
Keyboard Events: keydown, keypress, keyup
Form Events: submit, change, focus, blur
Window Events: load, resize, scroll

JavaScript Event handlers :
Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions


Event Handling Methods
1. Inline HTML Handlers

<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
2. DOM Property Handlers

let btn = document.getElementById("myButton");
btn.onclick = () => {
      alert("Button clicked!");
};
3. addEventListener() (Preferred)

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    alert("Button clicked using addEventListener!");
});
addEventListener() is the most versatile and recommended method as it supports multiple event listeners and removal of listeners.

Event Loop :
JavaScript is single-threaded, it uses the event loop to manage the execution of multiple tasks without blocking the main thread.

Event loop Working :
Call Stack: JavaScript has a call stack where function execution is managed in a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order.
Web APIs (or Background Tasks): These include setTimeout, setInterval, fetch, DOM events, and other non-blocking operations.
Callback Queue (Task Queue): When an asynchronous operation is completed, its callback is pushed into the task queue.
Microtask Queue: Promises and other microtasks go into the microtask queue, which is processed before the task queue.
Event Loop: It continuously checks the call stack and, if empty, moves tasks from the queue to the stack for execution.

Common issues :
1.Blocking the main thread => like infinite loop .
Example :
while(true)
{
    console.log('Blocking...')
}

2.Delayed Execution of setTimeout
Example :
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Inside setTimeout"), 1000);
for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {} // Long loop
console.log("End");

3.Priority of Microtask over callbacks => Promises will be done before callbacks
Example :
setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));
console.log("End");

4.Callback Hell
Example :
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Step 1");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Step 2");
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Step 3");
        }, 1000);
    }, 1000);
}, 1000);
