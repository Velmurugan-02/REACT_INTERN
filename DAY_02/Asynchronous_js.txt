Asynchronous JavaScript :
Asynchronous JavaScript is a programming approach that enables the non-blocking execution of tasks, allowing concurrent operations, improved responsiveness, and efficient handling of time-consuming operations in web applications, JavaScript is a single-threaded and synchronous language. The code is executed in order one at a time.

Approach 1 : Callbacks 
Approach 2 : Promises
Approach 3 : Event loop
Approach 4 : Async and Await

| Feature         | Sync               | Async        |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Execution       | One by one         | Parallel-ish |
| Blocking        | Yes                | No           |
| Performance     | Poor for big tasks | High         |
| UI Freezing     | Yes                | No           |
| Real-world apps | ❌                | ✅           |
| React / Node    | ❌                | ✅           |

Synchronous code blocks execution until a task completes, while asynchronous code allows JavaScript to perform long-running operations like API calls without blocking the main thread, improving performance and user experience.
