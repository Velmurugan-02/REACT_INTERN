| Feature      | var               | let       | const     |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Scope        | Function          | Block     | Block     |
| Re-declare   | ✅ Yes             | ❌ No      | ❌ No      |
| Re-assign    | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No      |
| Hoisting     | Yes (`undefined`) | Yes (TDZ) | Yes (TDZ) |
| Modern usage | ❌ Avoid           | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Best    |

var is function-scoped and error-prone. let and const are block-scoped, introduced in ES6. const prevents reassignment and improves code safety, so it’s preferred in modern JavaScript.

Use const by default
Switch to let only when mutation is required
Forget var like an ex who caused bugs
