Cookies Storage :
A cookie is a small piece of data (a name=value pair) that a website stores in the user’s browser. The browser automatically sends that cookie back to the same website on future requests (depending on rules like domain/path/SameSite).

Maintain sessions (because HTTP is stateless)
Remember preferences	
Enable analytics and tracking (controversial, but real)

Basic data structure
A cookie is basically:
Name: sessionId
Value: abc123
Attributes (metadata that controls behavior):
Expires / Max-Age (how long it lasts)
Domain / Path (where it’s sent)
Secure (HTTPS only)
HttpOnly (not readable by JS)
SameSite (controls cross-site sending)

A) Created & stored (server → browser)
Server sends an HTTP response header:
Set-Cookie: tells the browser “store this cookie”
Example shape:
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax
Browser stores it in its cookie jar (per domain/path rules).

B) Sent (browser → server)
On later requests, the browser automatically includes:
Cookie header:
Cookie: sessionId=abc123; theme=dark
This is why cookies are used for session auth: they naturally “ride along” with requests.

C) Managed (client-side JS)
JavaScript can read/write cookies via document.cookie only if they are NOT HttpOnly.
Read: document.cookie (returns a single string of all readable cookies)
Write: document.cookie = "key=value; ..."
Important: JS can’t set HttpOnly (only servers can).

D) Managed in React
React itself doesn’t provide cookie APIs. You use:
document.cookie directly (simple)
or a library like js-cookie (cleaner), especially for parsing.

Why cookies exist :
HTTP is stateless
Cookies allow websites to remember users and sessions

Cookies are mainly used to:
Maintain login sessions
Store user preferences
Enable analytics and tracking
Support personalization

Main Types of Cookies:
First-Party Cookies: Set by the site the user visits, primarily for functionality.
Third-Party Cookies: Set by external sites (e.g., advertisers) to track users across different websites.
Session Cookies: Temporary files deleted when the browser is closed.
Persistent Cookies: Remain on the device for a set period, remembering settings for future visits.

Example :
Auth cookies in React (real-world implementation)
Best practice: HttpOnly session cookie

Flow :
React sends login request with username/password
Server validates and responds with Set-Cookie: sessionId=...; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax
From now on, browser automatically sends cookie with requests

React checks “am I logged in?” by calling /me or /profile

React side: you must send requests with cookies

Using fetch :
await fetch("https://api.example.com/login", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  credentials: "include", // important: send/receive cookies
  body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
});

Using axios :
import axios from "axios";

axios.defaults.withCredentials = true; // send cookies on every request
// or per-request: { withCredentials: true }

await axios.post("https://api.example.com/login", { username, password });

Checking login in React
const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/me", {
  credentials: "include",
});
const user = await res.json();
