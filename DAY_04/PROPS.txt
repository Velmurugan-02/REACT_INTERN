Props :
In React, props (short for "properties") are used to pass information from one component to another. The main purpose of props is to allow a parent component to send data to its child components.
Props cannot be modified by the receiving component.
They are strictly for reading data and should not be altered.
Props can be updated when the parent component’s state changes.

Example :
import React from 'react';

function Greet(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
    return <Greet name="John" />;
}

export default App;

Syntax :
<ComponentName propName="value" />

NOTE :
Props can be used in both functional and class components. With functional components, props are passed as arguments to the function.

Props in React work by allowing data to flow from a parent component to a child component, making components dynamic and reusable.

Steps to use Props:
Define an attribute and its value (data).
Pass it to the child component by using props.
Render the props data.

How to set a Default Value for Props:
In React, defaultProps is a special property that allows us to set default values for props. This is useful when no value is passed for a prop, ensuring the component still works with a fallback value.
Greet.jsx:
import React from 'react';
function Greeting(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
Greeting.defaultProps = {
    name: 'Guest',
};
export default Greeting;

App.js:
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Greeting />
            <Greeting name="Alia" />
        </div>
    );
}
export default App;
