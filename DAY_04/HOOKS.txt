React Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, enable functional components to use state, lifecycle, and other React features without relying on class components.

Eliminate the need for class components for state and side-effect management.
Improve code readability and encourage a functional programming style.
Widely adopted in modern React projects for cleaner and more maintainable code.

Types of Hooks :
1.State Hooks 	   ===> Used to manage the state in the functional components.
2.Context Hooks    ===> Used to allows the functional components to directly access values from the ReactContextAPI
3.Effect Hooks 	   ===> Used to manage side effects 
4.Performace Hooks ===> Used to optimize the performance by avoiding re-renders or recalculations.
5.Resource Hooks   ===> Used to store mutable values or access DOM elements without triggering re-renders.
6.Custom Hooks     ===> User-defined functions that encapsulate reusable logic.

State hooks :
State hooks like useState and useReducer enable functional components to manage state in a clean, efficient, and modular way.

Context Hooks :
The useContext hook allows functional components to directly access values from the React Context API without prop drilling.

Effect hooks :
Effect hooks allow functional components to manage side effects in a structured and efficient manner

NOTE :
In React, state is a built-in JavaScript object used by components to store and manage dynamic data that can change over time.
When a component's state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to update the user interface (UI) to reflect the new data.

React Context API ===> The React Context API allows data to be shared across components without passing it through each level. 
It simplifies state management and avoids "prop drilling" in larger applications.
Props drilling ===> Data is passed through one component or another in a Hierarchy way.
