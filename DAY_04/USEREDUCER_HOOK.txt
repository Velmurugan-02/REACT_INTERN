UseReducer Hook :
UseReducer is a React Hook used for managing complex state logic in functional components where:
State consists of multiple related values
State transitions depend on previous state
Updates follow well-defined rules
It is an alternative to UseState, inspired by the Reducer pattern used in Redux.

Syntax :
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

Parameters:
reducer → A pure function that defines how state changes
initialState → Initial value of the state

Returns:
state → Current state object
dispatch → Function to send actions to the reducer

Reducer function structure
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ACTION_TYPE":
      return newState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });
